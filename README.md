# CTF_writeups

This repository will contain writeups of all CTFs that I will be doing throughout my cybersecurity journey (hopefully).

I created this repository after I had solved 62 CTFs (59 easy,3 medium on picoCTF) so I will be continuing from there on and I'll try to cover some writeups from my already solved CTFs

Initially, this journey started on picoCTF. I'm doing TryHackMe now as well so any room or CTF I solve, I'll try to upload the writeups in this repository or in the selfcyb3r repository

Although these were initially meant for self revision, I hope that this can also help anyone around the world who will be diving into such things
