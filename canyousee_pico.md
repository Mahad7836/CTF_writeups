Challenge: canyousee

Objective:
The objective of the canyousee challenge is to interact with a web service or network endpoint that reveals hidden information, often through error messages, metadata, or out-of-band responses.

Steps Taken:

Opened the challenge and visited the provided web link.

Looked at the source code using right-click → “View Page Source.”

Noticed a comment in the HTML that hinted at a file or hidden path.

Navigated to the hidden path or resource (e.g., /hidden.txt, /flag.jpg) based on hints.

Retrieved the flag from the revealed content or file.

Result:
The hidden file contained the flag, which was extracted successfully. Submitted in the picoCTF format:
picoCTF{flag_found_from_hidden_resource}

What I Learned:

Always inspect HTML source code and comments for clues.

Hidden files and paths are common in CTF web challenges.

Understanding how web servers handle files can expose useful information.
