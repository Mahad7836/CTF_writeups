Objective:
The objective of the DISKO 1 picoCTF challenge is to analyze a compressed disk image file, investigate its contents using basic Linux forensics tools, and recover a hidden flag stored within the image.

Steps Taken:
Identified the Disk Image File:
The challenge provided a file named disko-1.dd.gz, which appeared to be a gzipped disk image file. Running the file command confirmed that the file was gzip compressed data.

file disko-1.dd.gz

Decompressed the File:
To examine the actual disk image, I decompressed the file using:

gzip -d disko-1.dd.gz

This produced a new file named disko-1.dd.

Checked the Disk Image Format:
Using the file command again on the decompressed 
file disko-1.dd

The output revealed that this was a FAT32 filesystem:


DOS/MBR boot sector ... FAT (32 bit) ...
This confirmed the image could be navigated as a standard filesystem or parsed for strings.

Searched for Readable Strings:
Instead of mounting the image, I used the strings command, which extracts printable character sequences from binary files. Since flags are usually stored in readable form, this is a quick and effective method.

strings disko-1.dd | grep "picoCTF"

Discovered the Flag:
The output of the above command revealed the flag immediately:
picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}


Result:
The flag was successfully retrieved using basic forensic string extraction:

picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}


What I Learned:
How to inspect and decompress .gz files using gzip -d.
How to identify disk image formats using the file command.
How to use strings to extract readable data from binary files.
That sometimes, challenges can be solved without overcomplicating thingsâ€”look for the simple solutions first.
