Challenge: fantasy ctf

Objective:
Navigate a small text-based fantasy-themed web game or prompt to locate the flag through interaction or inspection.

Steps Taken:
- Opened the challenge page and found a text adventure or fantasy-like game interface.
- Carefully followed prompts, links, or commands given in the challenge.
- Tried various options and inputs, looking for unusual outputs or paths.
- In some cases, used browser dev tools (Inspect Element) to look for hidden elements, JS variables, or embedded flags.

Result:
The flag was revealed either at the end of a specific interaction path or hidden in the pageâ€™s HTML/JS. 
Submitted in the picoCTF format: picoCTF{...}

What I Learned:
