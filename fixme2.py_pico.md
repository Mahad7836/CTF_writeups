Challenge: fixme2.py
Objective:
Analyze a faulty Python script, identify the issue, and correct it in order to reveal the hidden flag.

Steps Taken:

Downloaded the fixme2.py file and opened it in a code editor.

Read through the script and noticed syntax errors or incorrect function use.

Made necessary change.

Saved the corrected file and executed it via terminal using python3 fixme2.py.

Result:
The corrected script displayed the flag in the picoCTF format successfully.

What I Learned:

Debugging and correcting Python scripts efficiently.

Reinforced understanding of Python basics such as variable handling, indentation, and print statements.

Learned to carefully trace the logic of code even when multiple bugs are present.
