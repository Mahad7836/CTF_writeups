Challenge: heap 0

Objective:
Understand and exploit basic heap vulnerability concepts using memory inspection to retrieve a flag.

Steps Taken:

Opened the challenge and was given access to a remote binary for exploitation.

Downloaded and examined the provided binary file locally.

Used strings and objdump to analyze the binary statically.

Connected to the remote server using nc (netcat) as per instructions.

Identified that the challenge was simulating a heap allocation scenario.

Interacted with the program by inputting data to allocate memory chunks.

Triggered the vulnerability by manipulating inputs and overwriting memory areas that werenâ€™t intended to be accessible.

Upon successful manipulation, the flag was printed on the screen.

Result:
The flag was retrieved after exploiting heap behavior and memory mismanagement. Submitted in the format: picoCTF{...}.

What I Learned:

Basics of heap allocation and memory chunk manipulation.
How vulnerabilities like buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or flag disclosure.
Use of basic static analysis tools (strings, objdump) and remote exploitation via netcat.
