Challenge: interendec

Objective:
The objective of the interendec challenge is to analyze a text that seems encrypted or encoded in an unfamiliar format, identify the pattern or scheme used, and decode it to retrieve the hidden flag.

Steps Taken:

Opened the challenge and downloaded the encoded text or viewed it on the challenge page.

Observed that the characters alternated between decimal-looking numbers and characters in a repeating sequence.

Suspected it was a form of interleaved encoding or possibly alternating between encoded and plaintext segments.

Found a short Python script to separate characters at even and odd indices, or analyzed ASCII values where needed.

Decoded the resulting string using common encoding schemes (ASCII/decimal/Binary).

Result:
Successfully decoded the mixed/interleaved content to reveal the flag. Submitted in the picoCTF format:
picoCTF{decoded_flag_here}

What I Learned:

How to identify and analyze interleaved or alternating encoding schemes.

Strengthened pattern recognition and decoding logic skills.

Used Python string slicing and ASCII decoding techniques to solve encoding-based challenges.
