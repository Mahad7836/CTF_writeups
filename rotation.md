Challenge: Rotation

Objective:
Cryptography

Steps Taken:
1. Downloaded file and opened it to check for cipher text
2. Suggestion and Name suggested that its a rotational cipher
3. Possiblities of ROT13/Caeser Cipher
4. Went online and used tools to brute force
5. Found the flag within 2 minutes

What I Learned:
1. analyse the cipher text closely ( first few letters meant picoCTF, that was a stronger hint for using the correct brute force mechanism)
