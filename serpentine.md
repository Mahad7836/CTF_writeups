Challenge: Serpentine

Objective:
To analyze python script and make changes to the code so that it can print the flag

Steps Taken:
1. Downloaded file
2. ran the python script
3. there are 3 options a,b,c
4. b says that it will print flag but when you enter b it doesnt
5. open the python file using any text editor, i used nano
6. check for functions defined and check what is being called when user enters b
7. found the print_flag function in first few lines
8. replace the print statement when user enters b with 'print(print_flag())'
9. compile and run script again
10. enter b
11. flag captured


What I Learned:
1. analyze the code properly for finding vulnerabilties
2. small errors can lead to leaks
